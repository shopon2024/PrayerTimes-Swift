# PrayerTime-Swift
Islamic Prayer (salah) Time calculation written in swift. This prayer time calculation code is *mostly* converted from Objective C version of similar class from [praytimes.org](http://praytimes.org).

## What it Does
It calculates prayer times for any date(s) based on:

* Latitude/Longitude
* Calculation Method
* Asr Method (Shafi'i/Hanafi)
* ... and optional higher latitude adjustment

> For more information about these calculation methods and how it is obtained, check out fine document at [prayertimes.org's wiki page](http://praytimes.org/calculation)

## Installation 

### Swift Package Manager

The [Swift Package Manager](https://swift.org/package-manager/) is a tool for automating the distribution of Swift code and is integrated into the `swift` compiler.

Once you have your Swift package set up, adding Alamofire as a dependency is as easy as adding it to the `dependencies` value of your `Package.swift`.

```swift
dependencies: [
    .package(url: "https://github.com/shopon2024/PrayerTimes-Swift.git", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

### Manually
Just import AKPrayerTime.swift in your project


## How to Use

``` swift
// Create PrayerKit instance with your latitude/longitude
var prayerKit:AKPrayerTime = AKPrayerTime(lat: 23.810332, lng: 90.4125181)
// Optionally, set your preferred calculation method.
// Default is Muslim World Legue (MWL) method
prayerKit.calculationMethod = .Karachi
// Optionally, set your preferred Asr method.
// Default is Safi'i
prayerKit.asrJuristic = .Hanafi
// Optionally, set your output format.
// You can obviously format it later also
prayerKit.outputFormat = .Time12
// ... and finally, get your times
var times = prayerKit.getPrayerTimes()

// Then, you can use it as
times[.Fajr]    // 04:07 am
times[.Sunrise] // 05:27 am
// ...and follow included example and public methods in source for more possibilities!
```
